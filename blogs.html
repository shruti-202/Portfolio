        <h3>Dare to Dream</h3>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold">T</span>his is my
          very first blog. I believe that we must all have the courage to take
          risks and pursue our dreams. It is critical that we trust our
          instincts. If we want to pursue something, we must do so. We must all
          understand that taking risks is preferable to regretting them later.
          We must pursue our dreams with complete honesty and sincerity.<br><br>
          According to a wise person, 6 months of consistency, dedication, and
          hard work can lead us 5 years ahead. So it's critical to be okay with
          being uncomfortable for a few years in order to live the life of our
          dreams. Everyone has the ability to learn new skills if they give
          themselves enough time, but the only requirement is that we show up
          every single day, no matter what. In the worst-case scenario, even if
          things did not go as planned, we will never have the regret of not
          trying it once. We must always prepare ourselves for listening to our
          inner voice and acting on it.
